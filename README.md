# DTDL2MD -- The DTDL to Markdown documentation generator

Author: [Karl Hammar](https://karlhammar.com)

This tool parses a DTDL ontology and generates a set of markdown files describing the content of that ontology.

It accepts either a single JSON file or a directory as input -- in the latter case, it traverses the directory recursively and parses all JSON files within it and its children.

It emits a set of Markdown files structured in accordance with the inheritance hierarchy of the parsed DTDL Interface models, and an index file listing all those interfaces.

For an example of how this might look, see the [RealEstateCore documentation](https://github.com/RealEstateCore/rec/tree/main/Doc).

## Usage

dotnet run -i C:\path-to-ontology -o C:\output-directory
